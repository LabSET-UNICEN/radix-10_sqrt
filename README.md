# VHDL implementation of Radix-10 restoring square root 
Efficient fixed-point and floating-point implementations in VHDL for radix-10 square root in Xilinx FPGAs devices. The sources implement digit recurrence with restoring algorithm, which supports the three decimal floating-point (DFP) types specified in the IEEE 754-2008 standard.
